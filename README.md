This is a thin wrapper around a database, and a script for generating that database. This code is used for [yiffy.af](https://yiffy.af).

Requirements
------------

To use `discourse.pl`, you will need:

- perl
- [CGI::Fast](https://metacpan.org/pod/CGI::Fast)
- [Math::Random::MT::Auto](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Random::MT::Auto)
- [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI)
- [DBD::SQLite](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite)
- [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime)
- [DateTime::Format::Strptime](https://metacpan.org/DateTime::Format::Strptime)
- an HTTP server that supports FastCGI scripts

To use `mkdb.pl`, you will need:

- perl
- [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI)
- [DBD::SQLite](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite)

Usage
-----

Plop `index.pl`, `static/`, and `discourse.db` (the last of which is generated by `mkdb.pl`) in to a directory configured for running FastCGI scripts.
